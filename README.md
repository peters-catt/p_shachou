"Hacking Tyrell Wellick... You’d think it would be tricky, but turns out, they haven’t updated their servers since Shellshock. People like him—they always think they're untouchable. But in reality, they’re just lines of vulnerable code waiting to be exploited." — Mr. Robot

💻 Open-Source: Linux is more than just an OS—it's a way of life.

💣 Pen-Testing: Exploring the art of offensive security and vulnerability hunting.

🧑‍🔬 Chemical Engineering isn’t just my major; it's a passion.

Whether it's simulations or process optimization, I dive into every problem like it's a cryptic code waiting to be deciphered.

🤖 Python for flexibility, C++ for power—both are essential weapons in life.

📐 Mathematics: Addicted to calculus, differential equations, and statistics. Math is the code of reality. Without it, we’re on an infinite loop.
 
Sometimes the system isn't hacked; it's just broken from the start.

🛠 Skills and Tools:
Linux (Debian, Arch, Ubuntu): Navigating Linux is like breathing—instinctual and essential.
Kali Linux: Inorder to protect it, first you need to destroy it

Windows Integration: Making Linux and Windows work together in a seamless symphony.
