"We’re all living in each other’s paranoia. They call me paranoid, but what if I’m right?"
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

"Say my name."
— Walter White, Breaking Bad

💻 开源革命
Linux isn’t just an operating system; it’s a mindset—a rebellion against closed walls, a commitment to freedom and innovation. As Elliot would say, "Power belongs to the people who take it."

💣 渗透测试
Penetration testing isn’t merely about breaking systems—it’s the ultimate chess match. A dance between art and intellect. Like Walter White, "I’m not in danger; I am the danger."

🧑‍🔬 化学工程
To me, chemical engineering is hacking the physical world—deconstructing reality and rebuilding it on my terms. "Chemistry is the study of transformation," said Walter White. And that’s exactly what I do: transform complexity into simplicity, chaos into order.

"People think chaos is random, but it’s not. It’s a pattern waiting to be decrypted."
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

🔐 Whether modeling a chemical process or reverse-engineering a network vulnerability, I see every challenge as an enigma. Problems are locked vaults; solutions are the master keys. "There’s a flaw in every system. You just have to find it."

🤖 Python for elegance. C++ for dominance. My arsenal is a symphony of precision and power, designed to crack open the impossible.
"When you see a good move, look for a better one." — Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

📐 数学
From calculus to statistics, mathematics is the universal language. If programming is the syntax, math is the algorithm underneath. Without it, we’re just "running scripts in a dead loop."

"The world is one big hack. The code? The equations. The exploit? Human greed."
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

🛠 技能与工具

Linux: Debian, Arch, Ubuntu—mastering these distros feels as natural as breathing. "It’s not the tool; it’s how you use it."
Kali Linux: To defend a system, you must first learn how to tear it apart.
Windows Integration: Bridging Linux and Windows into seamless harmony—a symphony of cooperation born from chaos.
"Every keystroke is a revolution. Every command, a step toward mastery."
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

"I am the one who knocks."
— Walter White, Breaking Bad
