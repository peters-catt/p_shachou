💻 Open Source Revolution
Linux is more than an operating system; it’s a philosophy—a rebellion against locked gates, a pledge to freedom and creativity. As Elliot Alderson said, "Power belongs to the people who take it."

💣 Penetration Testing
Pen testing isn’t just about breaking systems; it’s a strategic duel—a blend of artistry and intellect. Like Walter White, "I’m not in danger. I am the danger."

🧪 Chemical Engineering
To me, chemical engineering is like hacking the physical world—dismantling reality to rebuild it on my terms. As Walter White put it, "Chemistry is the study of transformation." That’s my craft: turning complexity into clarity and chaos into structure.

"People think chaos is random, but it’s not. It’s a pattern waiting to be decrypted."
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

🔐 Cracking Challenges

Whether modeling chemical processes or reverse-engineering vulnerabilities, I see every obstacle as a puzzle to solve. Locked vaults have flaws, and solutions are the master keys.
"There’s a flaw in every system. You just have to find it."

🤖 My Arsenal
Python: For precision and elegance.
C++: For dominance and power.
This toolkit is my symphony of code—designed to crack open the impossible.
"When you see a good move, look for a better one." — Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

📐 Mathematics
From calculus to statistics, math is the universal foundation. If programming is syntax, math is the logic driving it. Without it, we’d all be "running scripts in a dead loop."
"The world is one big hack. The code? Equations. The exploit? Human greed."
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

🛠 Skills & Tools
Linux: Mastering distros like Debian, Arch, and Ubuntu feels as intuitive as breathing.
Kali Linux: To protect a system, you must first learn how to break it.
Windows Integration: Bridging Linux and Windows into seamless cooperation—a harmony born from chaos.
"Every keystroke is a revolution. Every command, a step toward mastery."
— Elliot Alderson, Mr. Robot

"I am the one who knocks."
— Walter White, Breaking Bad
